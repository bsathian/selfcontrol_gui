# selfcontrol_gui

A Linux clone of the famous Mac application Selfcontrol (https://github.com/SelfControlApp/selfcontrol/) written in Python. A very alpha version that needs the terminal to run and relies on an additional text file. Essentially redirects a set of domain names from the text file to 0.0.0.0 by modifying the /etc/hosts file.

Requirements
1. PyQt6
2. sudo access


Instructions to run
1. create a blocked.txt file
2. run `sudo python gui_selfcontrol.py`  from the terminal
3. Set the timer
4. Have fun!
